Projectile Simulation Software - with Air Resistance &amp; Drag Coefficient Consideration

Fully-featured projectile simulation software, accurate to one-millionth of a meter, for the movement of an object through the air, 
accounting for air resistance caused by the drag coefficient of the object as well.
